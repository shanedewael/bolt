⚠️ Workflow [steps from apps](https://api.slack.com/workflows/steps) is a beta feature. As the feature is developed, **Bolt for JavaScript's API will change to add better native support.** To develop with workflow steps in Bolt, use the `@slack/bolt@feat-workflow-steps` version of the package rather than the standard `@slack/bolt`.

The [API documentation](https://api.slack.com/workflows/steps) includes more information on setting up a beta app.
